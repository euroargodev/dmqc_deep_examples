Examples of the DMQC analysis of deep Argo floats

This is a repository where DMQC operators of **deep Argo** floats can share examples and/or discuss difficulties on: 
- the application of a CPcor adjustment for salinity from SBS CTDs;
- the evaluation of sensor drift to the expected Deep-Argo salinity accuracy of 0.004.
- or any other topic related to **deep Argo** delayed mode quality control.

To share an example or a difficulty, please open a new issue:
